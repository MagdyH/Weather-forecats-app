# Weather-forecats-app

- Please do npm install at ` \ClientApp` and be sure that VS restore all packages before start the application.
-	I used ASP.Net Core version 3.1 to build APIs using controllers & models.
-	I applied API Key authentication using filters (middlewares), I prefer to use OAuth or JWT but in my application I don’t have user management  module at have access token per user, that’s why I thought API Key will be a good solution.
-	For front end I used React.js to build components that retrieve data from API and show list of the weather forecasts for the next 5 days.
